#jQuery HTML5 Uploader

jQuery HTML5 Uploader is a lightweight [jQuery plugin](http://plugins.jquery.com/) that lets you to quickly add an upload system [a-la-Gmail](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/drag-and-drop-gmail-attachments.html) into your web app.

You only need to create a dropbox element (i.e. a div) and jQuery HTML5 Uploader will do the rest. Then you can drag & drop one or more files on the element and the files will be uploaded.

It also works with the [multiple input file element](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.file.html).

The upload function is divided into two asynchronous operations: client side, the file is loaded in the browser memory with a [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) object. Useful if you want, for example, to show the image preview while uploading a picture. The server side operation consists in sending the binary file string to the postUrl (see settings).

It has been tested and works on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) and [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/).

	});
});
